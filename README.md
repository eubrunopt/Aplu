## Little Story
My first job was as a supermarket employee. I had never worked as such, and one thing that makes the work more complicated is the PLU's of the products. After working as a supermarket employee for a few years, I noticed that there was no app that the supermarket itself makes available to employees, so I decided to develop a small game to help gain more knowledge.

## Objetive
The purpose of the application is based on testing the user's knowledge of supermarket products.

## My Approach
Again I used flutter, because it is versatile and easy to understand.

So I started by defining several tasks so I don't get confused about what to do and change. After that an application of this type is not so complex in terms of complicated functions.

Get a random product, check if it's right and you're done!

I also wanted to add some other innovations that will probably distinguish itself from the competition, in which the keyboard is totally custom and a *copy* of the original used in the supermarket itself.

After a few weeks of development I then came up with a version that I feel comfortable having online for users to have a positive experience.

The application still has some small bugs, which do not complie the user experience.
